      <h1>Philip Emeagwali</h1>
      <p class="title">Philip Emeagwali is a Nigerian computer scientist. He has been living in 
        the United States for many years.[1] He won the 1989 Gordon Bell Prize 
        ($1,000) for price-performance in high-performance computing applications, 
        in an oil reservoir modeling calculation using a novel mathematical 
        formulation and implementation.[2][3]
      </p>

      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>Emeagwali was born in Akure, Nigeria on 23 August 1954.[4] His early 
        schooling was suspended in 1967 as a result of the Nigerian Civil War. 
        At 13 years, he served in the Biafran army. After the war he completed 
        high-school equivalence through self-study. He is married to Dale Brown 
        Emeagwali, a noted African-American microbiologist.[5]
      </p>

      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p class="education">He traveled to the United States to study under a scholarship following 
        completion of a correspondence course at the University of London. He 
        received a bachelor's degree in mathematics from Oregon State University 
        in 1977. He later moved to Washington DC, receiving in 1986 a master's degree 
        from George Washington University in ocean and marine engineering, and a 
        second master's in applied mathematics from the University of Maryland. 
        Next magazine suggested that Emeagwali claimed to have further degrees.[6][7] 
        During this time, he worked as a civil engineer at the Bureau of Land 
        Reclamation in Wyoming.

      <h3>Court case and the denial of degree</h3>
      <p>Emeagwali studied for a Ph.D. degree from the University of Michigan 
        from 1987 through 1991. His thesis was not accepted by a committee of 
        internal and external examiners and thus he was not awarded the degree. 
        Emeagwali filed a court challenge, stating that the decision was a 
        violation of his civil rights and that the university had discriminated 
        against him in several ways because of his race. The court challenge was 
        dismissed, as was an appeal to the Michigan state Court of Appeals.[8]

      <h2>Supercomputing</h2>
      <p class="supercomputing">Emeagwali received the 1989 Gordon Bell Prize for an 
        application of the CM-2 massively-parallel computer. The application used 
        computational fluid dynamics for oil-reservoir modeling. He received a prize 
        in "price/performance" category, with a performance figure of about 
        400 Mflops/$1M.[15] The winner in the "performance" category, was also 
        the winner of the Price/performance category, but unable to receive 
        two prizes. Mobil Research and Thinking Machines, used the CM-2 for seismic 
        data processing and achieved the higher ratio of 500 Mflops/$1M. The judges 
        decided on one award per entry.[3][2] His method involved each microprocessor 
        communicating with six neighbors.[10]
      </p>
      <p class="supercomputing1">Emeagwali's simulation was the first program to apply a pseudo-time approach
        to reservoir modeling.[1]

      <h2>Accolades</h2>
      <p>Price/performanceâ€“1989 Gordon Bell Prize, IEEE ($1,000 prize)[3]<br/>
        New African "35th-greatest African (and greatest African scientist) of 
        all time"[16]<br/>
        He was cited by Bill Clinton as an example of what Nigerians can achieve 
        when given the opportunity[17] and is frequently featured in popular press 
        articles for Black History Month.[18][10]
